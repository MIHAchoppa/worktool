## Example Interactions

### Adding Timestamps

```
Video Timeline: [=========>-------------] 5:30 / 15:00

Press Spacebar → Timestamp #1 added at 5:30

Overlay shows:
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Timestamps                   │
│ #1 - 5:30 [Click to seek]   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Recording Commentary

```
1. Click "🎤 Start Recording"
   → Status: "Recording started..."
   
2. Speak: "This section explains the main algorithm.
   The key insight is the use of dynamic programming..."
   
3. Click "⏹️ Stop Recording"
   → Status: "Recording saved! Click Transcribe to process."
```

### Transcription Result

```
Input: [Audio recording]

Output in Overlay:
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Transcription                            │
│ This section explains the main           │
│ algorithm. The key insight is the use    │
│ of dynamic programming to optimize the   │
│ solution from O(n²) to O(n log n).      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘

Generated Questions:
1. What is the main algorithm discussed?
2. How does dynamic programming optimize the solution?
3. What is the time complexity improvement achieved?
4. What are the key insights mentioned?
5. When would you apply this optimization?
```

## API Key Setup Example

### Getting Your Groq API Key

4. **Configure in Extension**:
   ```
   Open overlay → Enter API Key:
   ┌────────────────────────────────┐
   │ gsk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx       │
   └────────────────────────────────┘
   Click "Save API Key" ✓
   ```

## Advanced Usage

### Combining Multiple Features

**Complete Workflow Example**:

```
Timeline: Watching 45-minute tutorial video

0:00 - Start video
2:15 - Press Spacebar (Introduction complete)
5:30 - Press Spacebar (First concept explained)
5:30 - Start Recording
5:30 - Speak: "Great explanation of concept A..."
6:00 - Stop Recording

... continue watching ...

15:20 - Press Spacebar (Second concept)
15:20 - Start Recording
15:20 - Speak: "Concept B builds on A by..."
16:00 - Stop Recording

... continue through video ...

45:00 - Click Transcribe

Result:
- 8 timestamps marking key moments
- Full transcription of all commentary
- 5 questions covering main concepts
- Easy navigation to any marked moment
```

### Keyboard Efficiency Tips

1. **Keep hands on keyboard**: 
   - Spacebar for timestamps
   - Mouse/trackpad for recording controls

2. **Optimal recording timing**:
   - Record immediately after timestamp
   - Keep recordings 30-60 seconds
   - One recording per concept

3. **Review workflow**:
   - Watch video once, adding timestamps
   - Second pass: add recordings at timestamps
   - Final pass: transcribe and review questions

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Timestamp First, Comment Later

```
1. Watch entire video, pressing Spacebar at key moments
2. Go back to beginning
3. Click each timestamp to jump to that point
4. Record commentary for each timestamp
5. Transcribe all recordings together
```

### Pattern 2: Real-time Commentary

```
1. Start recording at video beginning
2. Speak thoughts continuously while watching
3. Press Spacebar at key moments (voice continues)
4. Stop recording at video end
5. Transcribe to get timestamped commentary
```

### Pattern 3: Question-First Learning

```
1. Watch video without recording
2. Add timestamps for unclear parts
3. Record questions at each timestamp
4. Transcribe your questions
5. Use AI-generated questions for comparison
```

## Integration Examples

### Export Workflow (Manual)

```
1. Complete transcription
2. Copy transcription text from overlay
3. Paste into your note-taking app
4. Copy timestamps list
5. Create reference links in notes
```

### Study Guide Creation

```
From one 30-minute video:

Generated Materials:
├── Timestamp list (8 key moments)
├── Transcription (your commentary)
└── Study questions (5 AI-generated)

Combine into study guide:
┌────────────────────────────┐
│ Topic: [Video Title]        │
│                             │
│ Key Timestamps:             │
│ - 5:30: Introduction        │
│ - 15:20: Main concept       │
│ ...                         │
│                             │
│ Notes:                      │
│ [Your transcribed thoughts] │
│                             │
│ Review Questions:           │
│ [AI-generated questions]    │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

## Troubleshooting Examples

### Example Issue: Spacebar Not Working

**Problem**: Pressing Spacebar doesn't add timestamps

**Check**:
```
1. Click on video player area
2. Ensure you're not in a text input
3. Check overlay is visible
4. Look for timestamp added confirmation
```

### Example Issue: Recording is Silent

**Problem**: Recording completes but transcription is empty

**Check**:
```
1. Check microphone permissions in browser
2. Test microphone in browser settings
3. Ensure you spoke during recording
4. Try a longer recording (5+ seconds)
```

## Tips and Tricks

### 1. Optimal Recording Length
- **Too short** (< 3 seconds): May not capture full thought
- **Optimal** (30-60 seconds): Good for single concept
- **Too long** (> 2 minutes): Hard to review, expensive to transcribe

### 2. Clear Audio Tips
- Speak clearly and at normal pace
- Reduce background noise
- Use headset microphone for best quality
- Pause between distinct thoughts

### 3. Efficient Timestamp Usage
- Don't over-timestamp (quality > quantity)
- Use for transitions and key concepts
- Combine with recordings for context
- Review timestamps before transcribing

### 4. API Cost Management
- Groq offers free tier with limits
- Combine multiple short recordings before transcribing
- Use question generation selectively
- Monitor your API usage in Groq console

## Next Steps
